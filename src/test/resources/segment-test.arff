% 1. Title: Image Segmentation data
% 
% 2. Source Information
%    -- Creators: Vision Group, University of Massachusetts
%    -- Donor: Vision Group (Carla Brodley, brodley@cs.umass.edu)
%    -- Date: November, 1990
%  
% 3. Past Usage: None yet published
% 
% 4. Relevant Information:
% 
%    The instances were drawn randomly from a database of 7 outdoor 
%    images.  The images were handsegmented to create a classification
%    for every pixel.  
% 
%    Each instance is a 3x3 region.
% 
% 5. Number of Instances: Training data: 210  Test data: 2100
% 
% 6. Number of Attributes: 19 continuous attributes
% 
% 7. Attribute Information:
% 
%     1.  region-centroid-col:  the column of the center pixel of the region.
%     2.  region-centroid-row:  the row of the center pixel of the region.
%     3.  region-pixel-count:  the number of pixels in a region = 9.
%     4.  short-line-density-5:  the results of a line extractoin algorithm that 
%          counts how many lines of length 5 (any orientation) with
%          low contrast, less than or equal to 5, go through the region.
%     5.  short-line-density-2:  same as short-line-density-5 but counts lines
%          of high contrast, greater than 5.
%     6.  vedge-mean:  measure the contrast of horizontally
%          adjacent pixels in the region.  There are 6, the mean and 
%          standard deviation are given.  This attribute is used as
%         a vertical edge detector.
%     7.  vegde-sd:  (see 6)
%     8.  hedge-mean:  measures the contrast of vertically adjacent
%           pixels. Used for horizontal line detection. 
%     9.  hedge-sd: (see 8).
%     10. intensity-mean:  the average over the region of (R + G + B)/3
%     11. rawred-mean: the average over the region of the R value.
%     12. rawblue-mean: the average over the region of the B value.
%     13. rawgreen-mean: the average over the region of the G value.
%     14. exred-mean: measure the excess red:  (2R - (G + B))
%     15. exblue-mean: measure the excess blue:  (2B - (G + R))
%     16. exgreen-mean: measure the excess green:  (2G - (R + B))
%     17. value-mean:  3-d nonlinear transformation
%          of RGB. (Algorithm can be found in Foley and VanDam, Fundamentals
%          of Interactive Computer Graphics)
%     18. saturatoin-mean:  (see 17)
%     19. hue-mean:  (see 17)
% 
% 8. Missing Attribute Values: None
% 
% 9. Class Distribution: 
% 
%    Classes:  brickface, sky, foliage, cement, window, path, grass.
% 
%    30 instances per class for training data.
%    300 instances per class for test data.
