This software was successfully compiled and ran on the CCIS Linux Lab Machines. You must use the Linux machines, as
the Java installation on the Windows machines is outdated.

Requirements:
- Linux
- Java 8 or higher

To compile run the following:
$ javac -d ./ src/main/java/me/joshuadriesman/clustering/*

There may be a warning, you can safely ignore this.

To run the program do the following:
$ java me.joshuadriesman.clustering.Main src/main/resources/segment-full.arff

After the software runs, the output will be stored in the results.csv file.

This will run the program on the full .arff located at src/resources/segment-full.arff. If you want to use a different
.arff file, you can edit run.sh and replace "src/resources/segment-full.arff" with the path to the .arff file you want
to use.
