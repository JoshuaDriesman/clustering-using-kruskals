This software was successfully compiled and ran on the CCIS Linux Lab Machines. You must use the Linux machines, as
the Java installation on the Windows machines is outdated.

Requirements:
- Linux
- Java 8 or higher

To compile run the following:
$ chmod u+x compile.sh
$ ./compile.sh

There may be a warning, you can safely ignore this.
You can also manually run the command inside the compile.sh file.

To run the program do the following:
$ chmod u+x run.sh
$ ./run.sh

After the software runs, the output will be stored in the results.csv file.

This will run the program on the full .arff located at src/resources/segment-full.arff. If you want to use a different
.arff file, you can edit run.sh and replace "src/resources/segment-full.arff" with the path to the .arff file you want
to use.
